make sure you have cv2 installed, if not, run bellow command as an administrator
"pip install opencv-python"

------------How to run 

take a picture of yourself and save it in the images folder, at least 3 to 5 to improve detection
name of picture is how the program will identify the face, so pick names resembling yours since
u cant save pictures with the same name

open "main.py" and run/excecute it

note:
if you are unable to run project using spider, u should install opencv through anaconda console
to do this, paste line 2 above in the anaconda prompt and press enter

this version still struggles to identify faces, so make sure u take picture in same place u want 
to test the program.
